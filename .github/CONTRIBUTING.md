# Docker Reverse Proxy Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to ***Docker Reverse Proxy***! Before 
submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read 
through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](#coc)
- [Got a Question or Problem](#question)
- [Submitting an Issue](#issue)
- [Submitting a Pull Request (PR)](#pr)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Help us keep development for ***Docker Reverse Proxy*** open and inclusive. 
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub 
issues for bug reports and feature requests. Instead, we recommend using the 
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/luisaveiro/docker-reverse-proxy/discussions) 
space.

## <a name="issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker or 
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/luisaveiro/docker-reverse-proxy/discussions) 
space, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might 
inform you of workarounds readily available.

You can file new issues by selecting from our 
[new issue templates](https://github.com/luisaveiro/docker-reverse-proxy/issues/new/choose) 
and filling out the issue template.

## <a name="pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing 
a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we 
request that contributors create an 
[issue](https://github.com/luisaveiro/docker-reverse-proxy/issues/new/choose) 
to first discuss any significant new features.
